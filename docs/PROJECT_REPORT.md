# NLP Resume Analyzer: Project Report

---

## Title

**Intelligent Resume Analysis System Using Natural Language Processing and Semantic Matching**

---

## Introduction

The modern recruitment landscape faces unprecedented challenges as hiring teams process hundreds to thousands of resumes per job posting. Traditional Applicant Tracking Systems (ATS) rely heavily on simplistic keyword matching, which has led to three critical problems: (1) candidates gaming systems through keyword stuffing and AI-generated content, (2) qualified candidates being filtered out due to synonym mismatches or formatting issues, and (3) recruiters lacking actionable insights about resume quality and candidate-job fit.

This project addresses these challenges by developing an intelligent NLP-based resume analyzer that moves beyond surface-level keyword counting. Using advanced natural language processing techniques including semantic similarity analysis, contextual skill extraction, and multi-dimensional scoring, the system provides transparent, evidence-based resume evaluation. The analyzer detects skills through normalized text processing with synonym support, scores resumes across five key dimensions (relevance, impact, structure, clarity, and gaps), and provides actionable recommendations for both recruiters and job seekers.

Built with a modular, extensible architecture, the system employs state-of-the-art NLP libraries (spaCy, Sentence Transformers) and maintains configuration flexibility through YAML-based skill and verb taxonomies. The platform delivers both a user-friendly web interface for individual analysis and a foundation for enterprise-scale batch processing capabilities.
